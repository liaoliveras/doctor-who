					<p>Lady Cassandra O'Brien.?17 is a fictional character from the long-running British science fiction television seriesDoctor Who. The character was voiced by Zoë Wanamaker, and was largely computer-generated,[1] although a physical prop was also used on set.</p>
					<p>The Ninth Doctor first encountered Cassandra (Lady Cassandra O'Brien.?17) in the episode &quot;The End of the World&quot;. They, along with the rich and powerful of the universe, were on Platform One, a space station orbiting Earth five billion years in the future, which was set up to witness the final destruction of the planet by the expansion of the Sun.</p>
					<p>ccording to Cassandra, her parents were the last to be buried &quot;in its soil&quot;. She had been born on Earth and lived on the edge of the &quot;Los Angeles Crevasse&quot;. Cassandra referred to herself as being &quot;a boy&quot; during this time. This could imply she was transgender; however, it may also be possible that the term &quot;boy&quot; in the contemporary vernacular may have lost its gender significance and come to mean simply &quot;child&quot;. Married several times, her life had been extended through a series of 708 plastic surgery operations, until she was nothing but a piece of skin stretched onto a frame, with eyes and a mouth, connected to a brain in a designer jar filled with a preserving solution below.</p>
