				<h1>The Villains</h1>
				<p><img src="../images/villains/index.jpg" width="300" height="300">Let's face it, you wouldn't watch <em>Doctor Who</em> if it wasn't for the villains. Over the years, there have been some genuinely terrifying baddies. We've made a list of the top ten below. <strong>The Weeping Angels</strong> anyone who's watched <em>Doctor Who</em> since its relaunch will know that the Weeping Angels are the scariest beings ever imagined by the show's writer Steven Moffat. As they are 'quantum locked', they can only move when you're not looking at them. But eventually you'll have to blink. And when you do, they get you. <strong>Davros</strong> oavros is easily the most maniacal <em>Doctor Who</em> villain. Not only is he the creator of the Daleks, which he did so he could become ruler of the Universe, he once tried to eradicate the whole of reality. He's also generally rather angry and likes to rant a lot. <strong>Cybermen</strong> much like the Daleks, the Cybermen have been stalwart enemies of the Doctor for many series. But rather than having an all-consuming hatred for living things, they just want to transform the human race into emotionless steel bots. On the plus side, if you did get turned into one, you wouldn't care. <strong>The Master</strong> The Master has taken many forms over the years from his first appearance played by Roger Delgado to John Simm's terrifying incarnation. Essentially, he is a timelord with the same powers as the Doctor. Except he's mad and evil, which, if you're wondering, isn't a great combination.<strong>The Daleks</strong> no Doctor Who villain list would be complete without a mention of the Daleks. Stripped of all emotion except for hate, they want to dominate the universe by exterminating everything with their lethal 'death ray' gun.</p>
